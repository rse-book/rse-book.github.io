## Gabrielle Edits






- This may also be a result of an old template but chapters no longer need to start on an odd numbered page. Please move up Chapters 4, 5, 8, and 9. You can leave the Glossary (starting on an odd numbered page), References, and Index sections how that how they are.
- After making all of the page number and chapter pages, the index will definitely need to be repaginated.
