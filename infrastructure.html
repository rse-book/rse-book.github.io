<p>Yes, there is a third area besides your research and carpentry level programming that I suppose you should get an idea of. Again, you do not have to master hosting servers or even clusters, but a decent overview and an idea of when to use what will help you tremendously to plan ahead.</p>
<section id="why-go-beyond-a-local-notebook" class="level2" data-number="7.1">
<h2 data-number="7.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-go-beyond-a-local-notebook"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Why Go Beyond a Local Notebook?</h2>
<p>Admittedly, unless your favorite superhero is Inspector Gadget or you just always had a knack for Arduinos, Raspberry Pis or the latest beta version of the software you use, infrastructure may be the one area you perceive as overhead. So why leave the peaceful, well-known shire of our local environment for the uncharted, rocky terroritory of unwelcoming technical documentations and time consuming rabbit holes?</p>
<p>Performance, particularly in terms of throughput is one good reason to look beyond desktop computers. Data proctection regulations that prohibit data downloads may simply force us to not work locally. Or we just do not want a crashing office application bring down a computation that ran for hours or even days. Or we need a server that is online 24/7 to publish a report, website or data visualization.</p>
</section>
<section id="where-to-go" class="level2" data-number="7.2">
<h2 data-number="7.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-to-go"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Where to Go?</h2>
<p>So, where should we go with our project when it outgrows the local environment of our notebooks? This has actually become a tough question because of all the reasonable options out there. Technical advances, almost unparalleled scalability and large profits for the biggest players made modern infrastructure providers offer an incredible variety of products to choose from. Obviously a description of product offerings in a vastly evolving field are not well suited for discussions in a book. Hence <em>DevOps Carpentry</em> intends to give an overview to classify the general options and common business models.</p>
<section id="software-as-a-service-saas" class="level3" data-number="7.2.1">
<h3 data-number="7.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="software-as-a-service-saas"><span class="header-section-number">7.2.1</span> Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</h3>
<p>The simplest solution and fastest time-to-market is almost always to go for a SaaS product – particularly if you are not experienced in hosting and just want to get started without thinking about which Linux to use and how to maintain your server. SaaS products abstract all of that away from the user and focus to do one single thing well. The <a href="https://shinyapps.io">shinyapps.io</a> platform is great example of such a service: users can sign up and deploy their web applications within minutes. The shinyapps.io platform is a particularly interesting example of a SaaS product, because R developers who come from field specific backgrounds other than programming are often not familiar with web development and hosting websites. Some of these developers for whom R might be their first programming language, are suddenly empowered to develop and run online content thanks to the R shiny web application framework that uses R to generate HTML, CSS and Javascript based applications. Still, those applications need to be hosted somewhere. This is exactly what shinyapps.io does. The service solely hosts web applications that were created with the shiny web application framework. This ease of use is also the biggest limitations of SaaS products. A website generated with another tool cannot be deployed easily. In addition the mere bang-for-buck price is rather high compared to self-hostimg as users pay for a highly, standardized, managed hosting product. Nevertheless, because of the low volume of most projects, SaaS is feasible for many many projects, especially at a proof of concept stage.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In case you are interested in getting started with shiny, take a look at the shiny case study in this book. The study explains basic concepts of shiny to the user and walks readers through the creation and deployment of a simple app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SaaS, of course, is neither an R nor a data science idea. Modern providers offer databases, storage calendars, face recognition, location services among other things.</p>

<h3 data-number="7.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="self-hosted"><span class="header-section-number">7.2.2</span> Self Hosted</h3>
<p>The alternative approach to buying multiple managed services, is to host your applications by yourself. Since – this applies to most users at least – you do not take your own hardware, connect to your home WiFi and aim to start your own hosting provider, we need to look at different degrees of self-hosting. Larger organizations, e.g., universities, often like to host application on their own hardware, within their own network to have full control of their data. Yet, self-hosting exposes you to issues, such as attacks, that you would not need to worry about as much in a software as a service setting (as long as you trust the service).</p>
<p>Self-hosting allows you to host all the applications you want on a dedicated machine. Self-hosters can configure their server depending on their access rights. Offerings range from root access that allows users to do anything to different shades of managed hosting with more moderated access. Backed by virtual infrastructure, modern cloud provider offer a very dynamic form of self-hosting: their clients can use a web GUIs and/or APIs to add, remove, reboot and shutdown nodes. Users can spin up anything from pre-configured nodes optimized for different use cases to containerized environments and entire Kubernetes (K8s) clusters in the cloud. Flexible pricing models allow to pay based on usage in very dynamic fashion.</p>

<h2 data-number="7.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-blocks"><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Exactly because of this dynamic described above and the ubiquity of the cloud, it is good to know about the building blocks of modern IT infrastructure.</p>
<section id="virtual-machines" class="level3" data-number="7.3.1">
<h3 data-number="7.3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="virtual-machines"><span class="header-section-number">7.3.1</span> Virtual Machines</h3>
<p>Virtual machines (VMs) remain the go-to building blocks for many set ups. Hence university IT, private sector IT, independent hosting providers and online giants all offer VMs. Virtual machines allow to run a virtual computers that have own operating system on some host machine. Running applications on such a virtual computer feels like running an application on a standalone computer dedicated to run this amplication.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Oracle’s Virtual Box is great tool to use and try virtual machines locally. Virtual Box allows to run a Virtual Windows or Linux inside Mac OS and vice versa. Running a virtual box locally may not be the most performant solution but it allows to have several test environments without altering one’s main environment.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="containers-images" class="level3" data-number="7.3.2">
<h3 data-number="7.3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="containers-images"><span class="header-section-number">7.3.2</span> Containers &amp; Images</h3>
<p>At the first glimpse containers look very much like Virtual Machines to the practitioner. The difference is that every Virtual Machine has its own operating system while containers use the the host OS to run a container engine on to top of the OS. By doing so containers can be very light weight and may take only a few seconds to spin up while spinning up Virtual Machines can take up to a few minutes - just like booting physical computers. Hence docker containers are often used as single purpose environments: Fire up a container, run a task in that environment, store the results outside of the container and shut down the container again.</p>
<p>Docker (<a href="https://www.docker.com/why-docker">Why docker?</a>) is the most popular containerized solution and quickly became synonym to container environments configured in a file. So called docker images are build layer by layer based on other less specific docker images. A DOCKERFILE is the recipe for a new image. Images are blueprints for containers, an image’s running instance. A docker runtime environment can build images from DOCKERFILEs and distribute these images to an image registry. The platform <a href="https://dockerhub.com">dockerhub</a> hosts a plethora of pre-built docker images from ready-to-go database to Python ML environments or minimal Linux containers to run a simple shell script in a lab type environment.</p>
<p>Containers run in a docker runtime environment and can either be used interactively or in batches which execute a single task in an environment specifically built for this task. One of the reasons why docker is attractive to researchers is its open character: Dockerfiles are a good way to share a configuration in a simple, reproducible file, making it easy to reproduce setups. Less experienced researchers can benefit from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Dockerhub</a> which shares images for a plethora of purposes from mixed data science setups to database configuration. Side effect free working environments for all sorts of tasks can especially be appealing in exotic and/or dependency heavy cases.</p>
<p>Beside simplification of system administration, <em>docker</em> is known for its ability to work in the cloud. All major cloud hosters offer docker environments and the ability to deploy docker containers that were previously developed and tested locally. You can also use docker to tackle <a href="appendix.html#glossary">throughput problems</a> using container orchestration tools like <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/">Docker Swarm</a> or <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">K8s (say: Kubernetes)</a> to run hundreds of containers (depending on your virtual resources).</p>

<h3 data-number="7.3.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kubernetets-k8s"><span class="header-section-number">7.3.3</span> Kubernetets (K8s)</h3>
<p>Though hosting Kubernetes is clearly beyond the scope of carpentry level devOps, the ubiquity of the term and technology as well as the touching points and similarities with the previously introduced concept of containers justify a brief positioning of Kubernetes. We cannot really see Kubernetes as a building block like the technologies introduced above. K8s is a complete cluster with plenty of features to manage the system and its applications. Kubernetes is designed to run on multiple virtual nodes and distribute processes running in so-called pods across its nodes.</p>
<p>Because Kubernetes is quite some overhead to manage, the big three and their alternatives all offer services such as a container registry to support their clients in running Kubernetes. Without any support and/or pre-configured parts it is…</p>
