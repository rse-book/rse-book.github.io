abstract = {While there have been a dozen of authoring systems and programming toolkits for visual design and development, users who do not have programming skills, such as data analysts or interface designers, still may feel cumbersome to efficiently implement a web-based visualization. In this paper, we present ECharts, an open-sourced, web-based, cross-platform framework that supports the rapid construction of interactive visualization. The motivation is driven by three goals: easy-to-use, rich built-in interactions, and high performance. The kernel of ECharts is a suite of declarative visual design language that customizes built-in chart types. The underlying streaming architecture, together with a high-performance graphics renderer based on HTML5 canvas, enables the high expandability and performance of ECharts. We report the design, implementation, and applications of ECharts with a diverse variety of examples. We compare the utility and performance of ECharts with C3.js, HighCharts, and Chart.js. Results of the experiments demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our framework. Since the first release in June 2013, ECharts has iterated 63 versions, and attracted over 22,000 star counts and over 1700 related projects in the GitHub. ECharts is regarded as a leading visualization development tool in the world, and ranks the third in the GitHub visualization tab.}

They can help define career paths and create long-lasting collaborations and opportunities. However, these opportunities are not equal for all. This article introduces 10 simple rules to host an inclusive conference based on the authors’ recent experience organizing the 2021 edition of the useR! statistical computing conference, which attracted a broad range of participants from academia, industry, government, and the nonprofit sector. Coming from different backgrounds, career stages, and even continents, we embraced the challenge of organizing a high-quality virtual conference in the context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and making it a kind, inclusive, and accessible experience for as many people as possible. The rules result from our lessons learned before, during, and after the organization of the conference. They have been written mainly for potential organizers and selection committees of conferences and contain multiple practical tips to help a variety of events become more accessible and inclusive. We see this as a starting point for conversations and efforts towards building more inclusive conferences across the world. * Translated versions of the English abstract and the list of rules are available in 10 languages in S1 Text: Arabic, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Tamil, and Thai.},
